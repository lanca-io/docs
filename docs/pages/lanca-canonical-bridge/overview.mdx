# Lanca Canonical Bridge

**Lanca Canonical Bridge** is a canonical cross-chain infrastructure that enables secure transfer of USDC between Ethereum and other blockchain networks. Built on top of **Concero Messaging V2**, it implements a Lock-Release mechanism on L1 (Ethereum) and Burn-Mint mechanism on destination chains to ensure 1:1 backing of bridged assets.

The bridge is designed with security as the primary focus, featuring isolated liquidity pools per destination chain, comprehensive rate limiting, and strict access controls.

## Key Advantages

- **True Canonical Bridging**: Full 1:1 backing through Lock-Release on L1 and Burn-Mint on destinations, with isolated pools providing transparent proof of reserves for each supported chain.
- **Universal Smart Contract Support**: Seamless integration for both EOAs and contracts through unified interface and client callback mechanism.
- **Multi-layered Security Model**: Rate limiting with automatic refill, emergency pausability and strict access controls protect against exploits and provide rapid incident response.
- **Battle-tested Infrastructure**: Built on Concero V2 Messaging with cryptographic verification, and decentralized relaying for maximum cross-chain reliability.
- **Future-ready Token Support**: USDC/USDC.e bridging with seamless migration path to native USDC as Circle expands cross-chain availability.
