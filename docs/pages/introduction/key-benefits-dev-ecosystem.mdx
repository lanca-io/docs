# Key Advantages to Developers and Blockchain Ecosystems

LBF gives developers and ecosystems the flexible and secure tools they need to grow. It provides the core infrastructure to easily build cross-chain apps while enhancing the network's economic stability and connectivity.

* **Easy, Permissionless Integration:** LBF offers developers permissionless on-chain integration. This means anyone can easily incorporate powerful cross-chain capabilities directly into their applications without needing special approval or complex configurations. By simplifying access to multi-chain liquidity, LBF empowers developers to build the next generation of innovative, interconnected dApps.

* **Exceptional Capital Efficiency:** Unlike bridges where funds often sit idle in pools, LBF's dynamic Parent-Child and Rebalancer system ensures liquidity is constantly flowing to where it's needed most. This active management maximises the use of capital across the network, creating a more efficient and economically stable foundation for cross-chain activity.

* **Secure Canonical USDC Bridging:** Ecosystems can utilise the Lanca Canonical Bridge for expanding their reach to other networks. It is a highly secure infrastructure for transferring USDC between Ethereum and other networks, built based on the [Circle's Bridged USDC Standard](https://www.circle.com/bridged-usdc). Designed with maximum security, it features isolated pools, automatic rate limiting, and emergency controls, allowing developers to confidently integrate a true canonical version of USDC into their applications. Importantly, it is future-ready for USDC.e bridging with seamless migration path to native USDC as Circle expands cross-chain availability.
