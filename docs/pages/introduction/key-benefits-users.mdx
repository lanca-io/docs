# Key Benefits to End-users

For the end-user, interacting with a multi-chain world should be simple and safe. LBF is built from the ground up to deliver a secure, reliable, and straightforward bridging experience that removes the complexities of cross-chain transactions.

* **Comprehensive, Multi-Layered Security:** Security is the top priority in LBF's design. The framework is secured thanks to [Concero V2 Messaging](https://docs.concero.io/introduction/concero-differences) with dual layer security model (cryptographic and economic security layer). All smart contracts undergo rigorous audits, and the IOU system uses strict validation to prevent fraud.

* **Seamless Scalability & Broad Connectivity:** LBF is built to grow effortlessly. It can quickly connect to hundreds of diverse blockchains, including Layer-1s, Layer-2s, and private enterprise chains. Thanks to its underlying infrastructure, a new network can be integrated in a matter of hours, ensuring LBF provides a unified liquidity layer for the entire digital asset landscape. Users can freely move their capital across networks with ease.

* **Frictionless User Experience:** For users, this translates to a smooth and reliable bridging experience with gas abstraction. Transactions are seamless with affordable fees and more predictable costs because the system's proactive rebalancing prevents the common problem of failed transfers due to low liquidity on a destination chain.
