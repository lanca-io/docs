# LancaSDK

The `LancaClient` class provides a set of methods for interacting with the Lanca API.

## Methods

### `getRoute`

#### Description

Retrieves a route for a given set of parameters. The route is an object that contains the necessary information for executing a swap.

#### Parameters

- `fromChainId` : `string`. The ID of the source chain from which the tokens will be swapped. This identifies the blockchain network where the tokens currently reside.
- `toChainId` : `string`. The ID of the destination chain to which the tokens will be swapped. This indicates the blockchain network where the tokens will be sent after the swap.
- `fromToken` : `Address`. The address of the token that the user wishes to swap from. This should be the contract address of the token being exchanged.
- `toToken` :`Address`. The address of the token that the user wishes to swap to. This should be the contract address of the token that the user wants to receive in exchange.
- `amount` : `string`. The amount of tokens to be swapped. This value should represent the quantity of the `fromToken` that the user intends to exchange.
- `fromAddress`: `Address`. The address of the user from whom the tokens will be taken. This is the wallet address that holds the `fromToken` and will initiate the swap.
- `toAddress`: `Address`. The address where the swapped tokens will be sent. This is the wallet address that will receive the `toToken` after the swap is completed.
- `slippageTolerance` : `string` . The maximum allowed slippage during the swap transaction, expressed as a percentage. This parameter is optional, with a default value of '0.5'. Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. Setting a slippage tolerance helps to ensure that the transaction will go through even if the market conditions change slightly during the swap process.

#### Return Type

- `Promise<IRouteType | undefined>`

#### Error Types

- `UnsupportedTokenError` - thrown when the specified token(s) is(are) not supported for swapping.
- `UnsupportedChainError` - thrown when the specified chain(s) is(are) not supported for swapping.
- `WrongAmountError` - thrown when the amount specified for the swap is incorrect.
- `TokensAreTheSameError` - thrown when the `fromToken` and `toToken` are the same.
- `NoRouteError` - thrown when no valid route is found for the swap.
- `TooHighAmountError` - thrown when the specified amount exceeds the allowed limit.
- `TooLowAmountError` - thrown when the specified amount is below the minimum required for the swap.
- `AmountBelowFeeError` - thrown when the amount is less than the transaction fee.
- `WrongSlippageError` - thrown when the specified slippage tolerance is invalid.
- `MissingParamsError` - thrown when required parameters are missing.
- `HTTPError` - thrown when there is an issue with the HTTP request during the swap process.
- `UserRejectedError` - thrown when the user rejected to sing the transaction

### `getRouteStatus`

#### Description
