# LBF Architecture Overview

LBF implements a modular architecture that separates **liquidity management** from **operational settlement/messaging logic** across a *Parent Pool* (Master chain) and multiple *Child Pools* deployed to target networks. This reduces the need for mirrored capital on every chain and improves capital efficiency.

The central *Parent Pool* is the primary entry/exit point for liquidity providers (LPs), while *Child Pools* provide instant local settlement and application-facing liquidity on their respective chains. Child pool states are periodically reported back to the Parent pool.

Interchain communication is handled by **Concero V2 Messaging**, and periodic operational orchestration (liquidity snapshots, batch withdrawals) is driven by **LancaKeeper**.

LBF supports a **hybrid liquidity management model**: an automated planning layer (Parent-assigned targetBalance) is complemented by a market layer — **Rebalancers**, who earn fees by correcting deficits/surpluses through an IOU mechanism.

**Core Components:** Parent Pool, Child Pool, LancaBridge (transfer initiator/executor contracts), ConceroRouter (cross-chain message router), ConceroPriceFeed (price oracle), LancaKeeper (automated operator), Rebalancers (market participants performing liquidity balancing).

## System Components

### Parent Pool (Master Chain)

Primary liquidity hub: accepts LP deposits, mints LP share tokens proportionate to pool ownership, processes batch withdrawals, and computes dynamic `targetBalance` values for all Child Pools.

The Parent Pool updates liquidity targets based on network activity and Child pool state reports (metrics + balances). Target distribution instructions are dispatched via Concero V2 Messaging.

### Child Pool

Local liquidity pool on a destination chain: holds funds for immediate settlement of transfers, periodically reports state back to the Parent Pool, and participates in Rebalancer deposit/withdraw (IOU) operations.

### LancaBridge

Contracts on source and destination chains that users call to initiate cross-chain transfers. They assemble the cross-chain payload, and relay it through the ConceroRouter. On the destination chain, the payload is validated and executed—either disbursing funds to the user or invoking the specified downstream contract.

### ConceroRouter (Concero V2 Messaging)

Secure delivery of cross-chain messages/instructions ensuring Parent↔Child consistency, IOU burn/mint, and interchain contract calls. Cryptographic and economic security properties come from Concero Messaging.

### LancaKeeper

Automated (off-chain + privileged on-chain) operator that:
1. Triggers periodic Child pool liquidity snapshots;
2. Initiates batch deposits/withdrawals at the Parent Pool;
3. Finalizes withdrawals once consolidated liquidity is available.

### Rebalancers

Independent actors who monitor pool status (`activeLiquidity` vs `targetBalance`) and quickly fill deficits (deposit) or remove surplus (withdraw) in exchange for **IOU** claims that can later be redeemed from surplus pools (with fee).

IOU redemption is permitted only from pools operating above their `targetBalance` — protecting operational liquidity. If a chosen pool is not in surplus, the Rebalancer must wait or select another pool for redemption.

## Operational Flows in LBF

### 1. LP Liquidity Deposit → Parent Pool

An LP sends assets to the Parent Pool → LP share tokens are minted proportionally (see formulas below) → aggregate pool value is updated → `targetBalance` values for Child Pools may be adjusted.

**LP Share:**

$$
\text{LP Share} = \frac{\text{User Deposit}}{\text{Total Pool Value}} \times 100\%
$$

**Share Token Mint Formula:**

$$
\text{Share Tokens} =
\frac{\text{Deposit Amount} \times \text{Current Total Share Tokens}}
{\text{Current Pool Value}}
$$

### 2. User Cross-Chain Transfer

1. User calls `bridge()` on the source-chain LancaBridge.
2. ConceroRouter relays the message to the destination chain.
3. Destination LancaBridge verifies the payload and executes payout (EOA or client contract).


### 3. Real-Time Rebalancer Role

A Rebalancer detects a Child pool deficit → deposits assets → receives IOU for the deposit amount → transfers IOU to a surplus chain (Concero V2 Messaging burn/mint) → redeems IOU for underlying assets + fee.

### 4. LP Withdrawal Logic

1. LP burns LP tokens in the Parent Pool to request withdrawal.
2. The Parent Pool *temporarily raises* its `targetBalance` by the withdrawal amount, intentionally moving itself into a deficit state — an economic signal to Rebalancers.
3. Rebalancers top up the Parent Pool toward the new target.
4. Once actual balance meets target, LancaKeeper finalizes the withdrawal and transfers assets to the LP. Withdrawal time depends on system rebalancing speed, not a hard fixed delay.

## Hybrid Liquidity Management

The LBF architecture blends **centralized liquidity target planning** (Parent Pool) with **market-driven reactiveness** (Rebalancers), minimizing idle capital while preserving fast local settlement.

### Pool Status Variables

For each pool the following are tracked:

- `balance`
- `rebalancingFees`
- `activeLiquidity = balance - rebalancingFees`
- `targetBalance` (dynamic goal set by the Parent Pool)

Comparing `activeLiquidity` to `targetBalance` yields one of three states: **Surplus**, **Balanced**, **Deficit**. These states govern which Rebalancer actions are allowed.

$$
\text{activeLiquidity} = \text{balance} - \text{rebalancingFees}
$$

### Monitoring Cycle

The Parent Pool + LancaKeeper collect regular Child pool snapshots and adjust `targetBalance` in response to network activity. When a Child Pool drifts from its target, Rebalancers receive an economic signal to act.

### Fast Rebalancer Adjustments

Rebalancers provide a “fast lane” between major Parent pool redistribution cycles: they deposit into deficit pools and withdraw from surplus pools using IOUs. This two-layer approach shortens system response time to load spikes.

### IOU Redemption Constraint

IOU redemption is allowed only if the target pool’s balance exceeds its `targetBalance`, protecting operational liquidity and preventing depletion. Without surplus, the Rebalancer must wait or choose another pool.

# Dynamic Liquidity Rebalancing Algorithm

To optimize capital allocation, the Parent Pool periodically recalculates each Child pool’s `targetBalance` using a **Liquidity Health Score (LHS)** that aggregates usage and stress metrics. The objective: move capital from “overfunded” pools to “high-demand” pools while keeping total system liquidity constant.

## Metrics

### Liquidity Utilisation Ratio (LUR)

$$
\text{LUR} = \frac{\text{Inflow} + \text{Outflow}}{\text{targetBalance}}
$$

Measures transaction intensity relative to the pool’s target. Higher volume vs target → higher utilization pressure.

**Normalization:**

$$
\text{LURScore} = 1 - \frac{\text{LUR}}{K + \text{LUR}}
$$

Sensitivity parameter \(K\) controls how quickly the score falls as activity rises.

### Net Drain Rate (NDR)

$$
\text{NDR} = \frac{\text{Outflow} - \text{Inflow}}{\text{targetBalance}}
$$

Positive → net outflow (stress). Zero/negative → stable or net inflow.

**Score:**

$$
\text{NDRScore} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \text{NDR} \le 0 \\
\max(0, 1 - \text{NDR}), & \text{if } \text{NDR} > 0
\end{cases}
$$

### Liquidity Health Score (LHS)
Weighted aggregate of LUR and NDR:

$$
\text{LHS} = W_1 \times \text{LURScore} + W_2 \times \text{NDRScore}
$$

### Recomputing targetBalance

1. **Weighting Function:**
Lower LHS → higher priority for capital allocation. Alpha is a sensitivity constant.

2. **Intermediate Pool Weight \(W_i\):**
$$
W_i = \text{Original targetBalance}_i \times f(\text{LHS}_i)
$$

3. **Normalized Redistribution:**
$$
\text{New targetBalance}_i =
\frac{W_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} W_j} \times \text{Total Liquidity}
$$

System-wide liquidity remains constant.

## LBF Security

The Parent-Child Pool architecture introduces a critical liquidity concentration at the Parent Pool, compromise at this level could cascade across all Child pools, so strict privilege controls and validation are required.

Reliance on cross-chain communication (Concero V2 Messaging) means message integrity and authenticity are essential to settlement correctness and liquidity flows. Message validation failures could misdirect assets between chains.

The IOU burn/mint mechanism is vulnerable to replay attacks unless strict cross-chain message *nonce* handling is enforced; reprocessing a valid message could double-mint IOUs and enable economic exploitation.
