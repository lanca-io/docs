# Lanca Bridging Framework (LBF)

**Lanca Bridging Framework (LBF)** is a fully decentralized cross-chain framework that enables seamless value transfer across blockchain networks by combining a *Parent-Child Pool* model, a dynamic IOU system, and hybrid liquidity management. The goal: eliminate liquidity fragmentation, improve capital efficiency, and scale interchain operations without compromising on security or decentralization.

LBF relies on **Concero V2 Messaging** as the secure transport for interchain messages/instructions and uses automated operators (**LancaKeeper**), independent participants (**Rebalancers**), and a price oracle (**ConceroPriceFeed**) to maintain correct and efficient pool states across networks.

## Key Advantages

- Unified liquidity layer: LPs deposit once (into the *Parent Pool*) and get fee exposure across all supported chains.
- Dynamically allocated liquidity via per-chain `targetBalance` values that adapt to network demand.
- IOU mechanism incentivizes fast Rebalancer response to liquidity deficits without over-parking capital.
- Flexible, configurable reward system for underserved chains (Progressive Reward Model).
- Multi-layer security model (cryptographic, economic, operational monitoring).
