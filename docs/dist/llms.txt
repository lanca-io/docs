## Docs

- [Get started](/getting-started): Welcome to the Lanca SDK documentation! This page will guide you through the process of getting started with the Lanca SDK.
- [LBF Architecture Overview](/lbf/architecture): LBF implements a modular architecture that separates **liquidity management** from **operational settlement/messaging logic** across a *Parent Pool* (Master chain) and multiple *Child Pools* deployed to target networks. This reduces the need for mirrored capital on every chain and improves capital efficiency.
- [Glossary](/lbf/glossary): **LBF (Lanca Bridging Framework)** â€” decentralized cross-chain liquidity framework enabling value movement between networks with high capital efficiency and security.
- [Lanca Bridging Framework (LBF)](/lbf/overview): **Lanca Bridging Framework (LBF)** is a fully decentralized cross-chain framework that enables seamless value transfer across blockchain networks by combining a *Parent-Child Pool* model, a dynamic IOU system, and hybrid liquidity management. The goal: eliminate liquidity fragmentation, improve capital efficiency, and scale interchain operations without compromising on security or decentralization.
- [Lanca Bridge Architecture](/v1/lanca-bridge/architecture): The architecture of Lanca Bridge is divided into two main components:
- [Contract Deployments](/v1/lanca-bridge/deployments): Arbitrum: [0x4459d95b396c418B2144943910E2e68548fFE589](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4459d95b396c418B2144943910E2e68548fFE589)
- [Interface](/v1/lanca-bridge/interface): Performs a cross-chain transfer of tokens from the source chain to the destination chain.
- [Overview](/v1/lanca-bridge/overview): Lanca Bridge is a cross-chain infrastructure that enables the transfer of value from one chain to another. Under the hood, it uses Concero Messaging as the execution layer and CCIP as the settlement layer.
- [LancaSDK](/v1/sdk/methods): The `LancaClient` class provides a set of methods for interacting with the Lanca API.
- [Data Types](/v1/sdk/types): A type representing a configuration for RPC.
